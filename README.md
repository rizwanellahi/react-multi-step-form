# React Multi-Step Registration Form

Multi-Step registration form built with [React](https://react.dev/) + [Formik](https://formik.org/) + [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) + [MUI](https://mui.com/)

## [Live Demo ↗️](https://react-multi-step-formik.vercel.app/)

**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Formik** takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff—keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission.

**Yup** is a JavaScript object schema validator and object parser that helps handle validation.

**MUI** Build beautiful UIs with ease. Start with Google's Material Design, or create your own sophisticated theme.
